            <li>First, mix your yoghurt marinade together.</li>
            <li>Marinate chicken for 20 minutes, or overnight if time allows. The longer it marinates, the more tender your chicken will be.</li>
            <li>Sear chicken in a skillet or pan. Keep those charred bits on the pan to make your sauce. Browned bits = flavour. If you have too many burnt pieces stuck to the pan, you can discard some of them if you wish.</li>
            <li>Finally, make your curry sauce in the same skillet.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h4> Sauce</h4>
        Easy to find spices, for example: garam masala, turmeric, cumin, red chili powder and salt, 
        are all you need to make a great sauce. You may even have some of these in your kitchen cupboards. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        It's all about the sauce when it comes to authentic butter chicken. You'll be surprised to find that you only need an onion, 
        a can of crushed tomatoes, garlic, ginger and some added spices to achieve those classic Indian flavours. 
        <br><br>
        The trick to making a great butter chicken sauce is to let the tomatoes cook off for at least 10-15 minutes, until they are almost dry 
        on your pan. Additionally, you can add in a couple tablespoons of water if it dries too early.
        <br><br>
        After that, blend until smooth and add in your cream (heavy whipping cream or thickened cream). You can use evaporated milk or half and half 
        for a lower calorie option.
        <br><br>
        If you want a richer sauce, feel free to add a couple tablespoons of butter (or ghee) right at the end, letting it melt through the sauce, 
        before serving. I like to serve mine over some coconut rice with a side of Garlic Naan.

        <h4>HOW LONG DOES BUTTER CHICKEN LAST IN THE FRIDGE?</h4>
        The beautiful thing about this butter chicken sauce is that you can prepare it ahead of time. Allow it to cool completely, store it in an airtight 
        glass jar or container and refrigerate for up to 48 hours.
        <br><br>
        Making ahead of time will allow those deep flavours plenty of time to develop and shine through before adding your chicken. Of course, this is 
        completely optional.
        <br><br>
        If there's any Indian recipe that's worth making at home, it's butter chicken and this is the best butter chicken recipe you could try!

        <h3>Instructions : </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 30 minutes to 
                an hour (or overnight if time allows).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, 
                making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. 
                (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)</li>
            <li>Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned 
                bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. </li>
            <li>Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let cook for 
                about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens 
                and becomes a deep brown red colour.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help 
                it blend (up to ¼ cup). Work in batches depending on the size of your blender.</li>
            <li>Pour the puréed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream, sugar and crushed kasoori methi (or fenugreek leaves) through the sauce. 
                Add the chicken with juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce 
                is thick and bubbling.</li>
        </ol>
